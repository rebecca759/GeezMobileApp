# Title: Geez Learning App
# Brief Idea of the Project
This project is aimed at creating an easy way to learn the Geez language for Amharic speakers. 
It will include different teaching levels and a user will have access to the next level of learning if 
he/she passes the test provided for the current level. The app will have 3 roles: an administrator, 
teacher and student. Teachers will be responsible for creating the content available on learning 
pages and also create tests for different teaching levels. The administrator will approve 
and post/update the content created by the teacher or deny it. Students will view the lessons provided 
at each level, take the test for that level and access next level if he/she passes the test.

## Features List
•	Authentication and Authorization

•	CRUD on lessons provided for each teaching level - teachers will create the content and the admin can update or delete the content and all users will read it.

•	CRUD on questions for the tests – questions created on the tests could get updated or deleted by the admin and are read by all users.

•	Giving/Denying access to the next level based on a user’s score on the current level’s test. 

•	Students can make comments on the lessons and teachers or fellow students can reply to the comment.
